# Natural-Gas-Price-Prediction-using-Deep-learning-models
Implements Naïve, Dense, LSTM, and N-BEATS models to forecast Henry Hub weekly spot prices (1997-01-10–2024-01-05). Reproduces preprocessing (80/20 split, sliding windows), training, and MAE/MSE/RMSE/MAPE evaluation; N-BEATS delivers the lowest errors across all metrics.
